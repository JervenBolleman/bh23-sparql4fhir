# Background

HL7 FHIR is a global standard for accessing and sharing electronic medical records in secure environments. In recent years, FHIR has gained broader adoption among health IT and the major Electronic Health Record (EHR) system vendors. FHIR defines a metamodel, a core clinical model, and a resource-oriented RESTful API for querying FHIR repositories. FHIR also defines a path language called FHIR Path that can be used to filter and project the results of FHIR queries. FHIR Data has been available as RDF since release R2, and reached tech maturity level 3 but is not yet normative. FHIR RDF is supported by a number of FHIR platforms and by the HAPI FHIR library.

## Motivation

Medical information is often stored within closed proprietary system as semistructured data. Yet, access to medical information in a structured, standard and interoperable format is key to promoting innovation in medicine, science, and health information technology. This is especially apparent in the area of translational medicine where discoveries in biotechnology have the potential to impact medicine in significant ways. 

By allowing the retrieval of clinical information using common semantic web technologies such as SPARQL, researchers will be able to use familiar tooling to integrate clinical information with their existing knowledgebases. FHIR offers a method to return clinical data in RDF format. However, it currently does not support SPARQL - a common way to query RDF data. As a result, to support a SPARQL query interface often requires loading all needed data from an existing FHIR Source into a separate SPARQL-capable database. This approach is undesirable for reasons of security and data freshness. SPARQL support allows organizations to provide researchers and health data integrators the capability for analytical queries that are outside of the design sweetspot of FHIR while leveraging their existing health IT infrastructure and security systems. 

## Vision

To enable SPARQL support in existing FHIR-enabled clinical systems. 

# Goals

* Stand up a SPARQL endpoint
* Translate the incoming SPARQL query into a valid query against the FHIR API. 
* Return a valid SPARQL result set
* Operate solely against the FHIR search API thus decoupling queries from the persistence layer as various configurations may exist within health systems.

# Outcomes

[TODO Integrate this text here: This works only for a small subset of SPARQL as the query languages are quite different in their expressive power. Therefore we aimed to use an existing SPARQL engine and use its evaluation strategy to ensure correct SPARQL semantics. Doing this we will maintain all options for an as efficient as possible retrieval strategy from FHIR PATH capable datastores. Including filter pushdown and constant bindings.  ]

We have a working prototype that allows for SPARQL queries matching the FHIR RDF R5 specification to be answered by a standard SPARQL protocol compliant endpoint. This includes general SPARQL optimisations but also pattern recognition. 

The engine chosen for this project is the Apache Jenaâ€™s ARQ engine. In this engine architecture we only need to replace standard parts of the SPARQL algebra with specific operators that we call HapiOps. HapiOps: use the hapi java clients for FHIR PATH over REST to talk to a FHIR data resource. HapiOps are the glue between the standard Jena SPARQL engine evaluation and the FHIR Path query language. Using the FHIR REST client as the base for our implementation means that this SPARQL engine can use any compliant FHIR data resource.

## Query manipulation with ArcTrees

The code recognizing which SPARQL fragments can be mapped to a FHIR Path query was derived from the FHIR RDF ShEx data shapes. Originally evaluated in JS this has been translated into Java.

The SPARQL algebra includes triple patters and path patterns. While technically, intersesction of the variables in the subject and object positions express a graph, the data model being queried is a sparsely-interlinked tree. The FHIR Path queries which allow efficient selection and transformation of remote data are defined as paths from a FHIR Resource's root node. Expressing the SPARQL query as a tree (called "ArcTree") with some interconnecting variables provided a structure homologous to FHIR Path's tree path expressions. This enabled the recognition of all applicable paths, i.e. those that correspond to the SPARQL query and have values that are either constants in the SPARQL query or variables already bound by an earlier join.

# Future work

As with any database query, there is a long tail of possible optimizations. For instance, we could push down SPARQL filters into the where clauses of the FHIR Path. The code that manages the conversion of FHIR Path result bundles into SPARQL result sets are far from ideal in respect to long term performance. Significant testing to ensure that no FHIR concepts have been forgotten or mistranslated. 

SPARQL and OWL allow completing FHIR path result queries when using coding systems that have logical extensions such as Snomed CT and LOINC. E.g. querying for a more general LOINC code should retrieve all observations coded with a more specific child LOINC code. Efficient implementation of the consequences of OWL derived query rewriting into FHIR Path is an open issue that needs more development efforts.

## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank the fellow participants at BioHackathon 2023 for their collaboration and constructive advice, which greatly influenced our project. We are grateful to the organizers for providing this platform and the developers of open source language models. Special thanks to our mentors, advisors, and colleagues for their guidance and support. Without their contributions, our project in linked data standardization with LLMs in bioinformatics would not have been possible.
